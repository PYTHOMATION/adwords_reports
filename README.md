### Automation Framework ###
* A framework for quickly building script-based functionality for common Marketing APIs like Google AdWords or Facebook (so far only Google AdWords is supported).
* Common goals of such scripts are:
    * clean accounts -> improve data quality
    * adjust ads -> improve customer experience + raise CTR of our ads
    * adjust bids -> improve cost efficiency of our accounts
    * create negative keywords -> reallocate search queries to more suitable keywords and/or block bad traffic
* Therefore most scripts will
    1. gather custom input
    1. gather account information from AdWords
    1. compute changes
    1. upload updated parameters back to AdWords

### Technology ###
* Everything is built with Python. I'm using python 3.6. and didn't check for compatibility with other Python versions
* All scripts heavily rely on the Pandas package: a very good, easy and powerful data analysis library

### How do I get set up? ###
[Needs to be rewritten and adapted to new approach]
* Install python 3.6.
    * Some functions might be broken with earlier python versions
    * Check out pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv if you have an older python version
* Download the code of this repository
